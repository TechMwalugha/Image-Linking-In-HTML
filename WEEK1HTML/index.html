                    <p>Software Engineer based in Kenya, specializing in technical education through hands-on learning and building applications.
                        I am currently at Kabarak University in my 3 year of study, pursuing a degree in Computer Security and forensics. I am passionate about web development and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1em;">When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing piano, reading, and watching movies. I also enjoy learning new things and meeting new people. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect.

            <h3>Projects</h3>

            <p>I've embarked on numerous projects throughout the years, but these are the ones I hold closest to my heart. Many of them are open-source, so if you come across something that piques your interest, feel free to explore the codebase and contribute your ideas for further enhancements. Your collaboration is highly valued!</p>
